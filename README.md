# don-chan-key-combo README IN ITALIANO SE SI VUOLE CAPIRE IL PROCEDIMENTO C'E UN FILE PROCESSO DI PRODUZIONE IN  CUI VIENE SPIEGATO QUELLO CHE PENSO


## Features
This project is designed to play a sound with every keyboard click within a certain timeframe. For now, I have used the "Don Chan" sound to create a specific combo, as it was my first idea. Of course, you can deactivate it with just a button. Future updates will include different sounds like cream, thick, thoc, and more. This is a great program for those who appreciate the typing experience and love the touch of the keyboard.
